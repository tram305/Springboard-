My Capstone project is about improving quality performance in airline industry through data mining. 
The data is scraped from airlinequality.com and collected by https://github.com/quankiquanki/skytrax-reviews-dataset 
In this project, my aim is to find which features have strong correlations with overall rating of airlines, and the strength of 
the relationship. This will not only reveal the feature that airlines should focus to improve their customer satisfaction (which
in turn brings more profits and revenues for airlines) but also give them measurements of the impact when they try to improve 
these features (through coefficients). 
The project is conducted with advanced models in data mining such as regression, ensemble tree... and training models by 
cross validation, grid search.
